# 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth (DiD) Deployment Guide & Study Notes

---

## 1. 🔑 **Definition of Defense-in-Depth**

- **Defense-in-Depth (DiD)** = Multi-layered security strategy that uses **several overlapping security controls** at different levels.
    
- Goal → If one defense layer fails, **others still protect**.
    
- Based on: **People + Technology + Policies**.

## 2. 🏗️ **Core Security Layers**

### Layer 1 – **Perimeter Security**

- **Firewall (NGFW – Next-Gen Firewall)**
    
    - Controls inbound/outbound traffic.
        
    - Features: Packet filtering, stateful inspection, deep packet inspection, application control, SSL/TLS inspection.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Place at **network edge** between internet and internal LAN.
            
        - Use **segmentation** (VLANs, DMZ, internal firewalls).
            
        - Configure **deny-all by default** policy.
            
- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)**
    
    - IDS → Monitors traffic & alerts.
        
    - IPS → Monitors & actively blocks malicious activity.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - **Inline (IPS)** – sits between firewall & LAN.
            
        - **Out-of-band (IDS)** – passive, analyzes mirrored traffic.
            
        - Keep signatures updated & use anomaly-based detection.
            

---

### Layer 2 – **Internal Network Security**

- **Network Segmentation**
    
    - Create **DMZ** for public-facing services (web, mail, DNS).
        
    - Use VLANs to isolate sensitive systems (e.g., HR, Finance).
        
    - Apply firewall rules between segments.
        
- **Bastion Host**
    
    - A **hardened server** used as a **secure entry point** for admins.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Place in **DMZ**.
            
        - Allow SSH/RDP only via **VPN or MFA**.
            
        - Minimal services installed → reduces attack surface.
            
        - Log and monitor all activity.
            
- **Honeypots / Honeynets**
    
    - Decoy systems used to lure attackers.
        
    - Detect and analyze intrusions.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Isolated environment.
            
        - Sends logs to SIEM for threat intelligence.
            

---

### Layer 3 – **Endpoint & Host Security**

- **Endpoint Protection (EPP) & EDR/XDR**
    
    - Antivirus + behavioral monitoring + ransomware protection.
        
    - EDR/XDR adds **forensics, threat hunting, rollback capabilities**.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Install agents on all endpoints/servers.
            
        - Centralized monitoring with SOC (Security Operations Center).
            
        - Use whitelisting for critical servers.
            
- **Hardening Hosts**
    
    - Disable unused ports/services.
        
    - Apply **OS & application patches** regularly.
        
    - Enforce **least privilege** (RBAC).
        
    - Enable logging & auditing.

### Layer 4 – **Application Security**

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
    
    - Protects web apps against **SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI/RFI**.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Inline before web servers.
            
        - Use positive security model (allow known good).
            
        - Integrate with SIEM for log correlation.
            
- **Secure SDLC**
    
    - Code reviews, static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST).
        
    - Secrets management, dependency scanning.
        

---

### Layer 5 – **Monitoring & Response**

- **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)**
    
    - Centralized log collection (firewall, IDS/IPS, endpoints, servers).
        
    - Real-time correlation & alerting.
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - Configure **log forwarding** from all devices.
            
        - Apply **use cases & detection rules** (e.g., brute force, lateral movement).
            
        - Integrate with SOAR for automated responses.
            
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
    
    - Enrich SIEM alerts with global IOC (Indicators of Compromise).
        

---

### Layer 6 – **Identity & Access**

- **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**
    
    - Principle → “Never trust, always verify.”
        
    - Deployment:
        
        - MFA everywhere (VPN, endpoints, admin portals).
            
        - Micro-segmentation (least access to apps/data).
            
        - Continuous authentication.
            
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**
    
    - Centralized authentication (LDAP, AD, Azure AD).
        
    - Role-based access.
        
    - Just-in-time privileged access.
        

---

### Layer 7 – **Data Security**

- Encryption (TLS, AES-256, disk-level encryption).
    
- DLP (Data Loss Prevention) to prevent exfiltration.
    
- Backup strategy (3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite).
